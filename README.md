### First-time Setup

1. To install dependencies, just do this in the root directory:

```terminal
yarn install
```

2. Create a `.env` file:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Set up an [Infura account](https://infura.io/). Create a new project. Copy the project secret to the `INFURA_ID` environment variable in your `.env` file.

4. Generate a jwt secretÂ and set it to ETHEREUM_JWT_SECRET in your `.env` file:

```
echo "ETHEREUM_JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)" >> .env
```

5. Set up the database:

```
yarn rw prisma migrate dev
```

### Fire it up


```terminal
yarn redwood dev
```

Your browser should open automatically to `http://localhost:8910` to see the web app. Lambda functions run on `http://localhost:8911` and are also proxied to `http://localhost:8910/.redwood/functions/*`.
